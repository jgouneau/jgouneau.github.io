I use *Obsidian* for my **knowledge management** as a *Zettlekasten*, and for **project management** using the *GTD method*, all of it organized in a *PARA* like structure. I can connect this system to academic reading and writing using plug-ins related to *Zotero*.

Key Points :
- The PARA method - *the big picture* : https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/
- Getting Things Done (GTD) - *managing the details* : https://hamberg.no/gtd
- An Obsidian introduction - *the tool* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYJsGksojms
- The Zettlekasten - *the knowledge core* : https://zettelkasten.de/overview/
- Building a Second Brain - *the illustrated summup* : https://maggieappleton.com/basb
- Connecting Zotero to Obsidian notes - *an example of academic application* : https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd
